## Odin Changes in Detail

### Dynamic Literals are now disallowed

Hidden allocations in Odin are `[dynamic]` arrays and `map` literal declarations. These allocate memory without the user potentially knowing.

An example would be:

```odin
main :: proc() {
    test: map[int]string = {
        0 = "zero",
        1 = "one",
        2 = "two",
        3 = "three",
    }
}
```

Now this is not supported anymore and can only be turned on explicitly through the flag `#+feature dynamic-literals` to have backwards compatibility when necessary.

### `map_entry` builtin

A new builtin to help in cases where you want to lookup if something exists in a map, return a pointer to the value or insert something new + return the final pointer in the map

Here is an example of it being used in the `core:strings` intern library. This is a call which has to be efficient as it may get called many times.

### SDL3 Support

If you didn't catch it yet, [SDL3 has been released](https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/announcing-the-sdl-3-official-release/57149).

Odin Vendor packages strive to support the most commonly used libraries, so of course we support SDL3 just like we did SDl2!

Here is the vendor package [vendor:SDL3](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/tree/master/vendor/sdl3)

### Odin C Bindings Generator

Look there is a new C Bindings generator!
This one does the popular approach which uses clang to output an ASST and then turns it into odin code.
